#### This research focuses on developing an *AI-powered smartphone application* to improve the quality of life for *Alzheimer's patients* and their *caregivers. The project aims to address critical challenges faced by patients, including cognitive decline, emotional distress, and difficulty adhering to daily routines. By leveraging advanced technologies like **Natural Language Processing (NLP), **speech recognition, and **machine learning*, the system provides a holistic approach to Alzheimer's care.
